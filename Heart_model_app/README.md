# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project predicts whether a person is likely to have **heart disease** based on various medical attributes using Machine Learning techniques.  
It is developed as part of an **internship project** to demonstrate data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build an accurate Machine Learning model that can help in the **early detection of heart disease** using patient health data.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes medical attributes such as:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol Level  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Resting ECG  
- Maximum Heart Rate  
- Exercise Induced Angina  
- ST Depression  
- Slope of ST Segment  
- Number of Major Vessels  
- Thalassemia  
- Heart Disease (Target Variable)
