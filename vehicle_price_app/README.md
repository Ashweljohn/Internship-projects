# 🚗 Vehicle Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to predict the **selling price of a vehicle** based on various features such as vehicle age, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and engine specifications.  
It is developed as part of an **internship project** to demonstrate the complete Machine Learning workflow.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a Machine Learning model that can accurately estimate vehicle prices and deploy it using a simple user interface.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains vehicle-related information including:
- Vehicle Name / Brand
- Year of Manufacture
- Fuel Type
- Transmission Type
- Mileage
- Engine Capacity
- Selling Price (Target Variable)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit (for GUI)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  

The model with the best performance was selected for final prediction.
