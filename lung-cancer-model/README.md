# 🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have **lung cancer** based on medical and lifestyle-related attributes using Machine Learning techniques.  
It is developed as part of an **internship project** to demonstrate the end-to-end ML workflow, from data preprocessing to prediction.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains various health and lifestyle attributes such as:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Smoking Habit  
- Yellow Fingers  
- Anxiety  
- Peer Pressure  
- Chronic Disease  
- Fatigue  
- Wheezing  
- Alcohol Consumption  
- Shortness of Breath  
- Chest Pain  
- Lung Cancer (Target Variable)
