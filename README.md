# 🚀 Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains **four Machine Learning projects** developed as part of my internship.  
Each project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Vehicle Price Prediction
- Predicts the **selling price of vehicles** based on features such as year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and engine specifications.
- Algorithms Used:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Output: Estimated vehicle price

---

### 2️⃣ Mobile Price Prediction
- Classifies mobile phones into **price ranges** based on hardware and technical specifications.
- Algorithms Used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Output: Price category (Low / Medium / High / Very High)

---

### 3️⃣ Heart Disease Prediction
- Predicts whether a person is likely to have **heart disease** based on medical attributes.
- Algorithms Used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNN
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Output: Heart disease detected or not

---

### 4️⃣ Lung Cancer Prediction
- Predicts the likelihood of **lung cancer** using health and lifestyle-related data.
- Algorithms Used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest Classifier
